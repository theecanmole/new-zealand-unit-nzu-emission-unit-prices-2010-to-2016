# New-Zealand-Unit-NZU-emission-unit-prices-2010-to-2016

New Zealand Emission Unit Prices in the NZ Emissions Trading Scheme 2010 to 2016. 
New Zealand has had an emissions trading scheme since 2009. Although private sector carbon brokers such as https://www.commtrade.co.nz/ and http://www.carbonforestservices.co.nz/carbon-prices.html display current and some historic prices of the NZ emission unit ("NZU"), there is no open public data series of the New Zealand carbon price. 

So I decided to make a monthly data series by digitizing images of price graphs via the programme G3Data and via the website http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/app/. The values obtained in this way are best thought of as being similar (but certainly not identical) to a monthly mean. The accuracy is perhaps + - 20 cents NZD. The data file "NZU-price-data-2010-2015.csv" is also available from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kVaWs_G_Uy8ifesqRWEY5V4mAuf6BPZNt6-lte3IuJA
